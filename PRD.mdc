# DevMantse Portfolio - Dashboard-Style Web Application

## üéØ Project Overview

Create a modern portfolio website that functions as a **SaaS-style dashboard application** rather than a traditional scrolling portfolio. The goal is to demonstrate advanced UI/UX skills, component architecture, and interactive design through a fully navigable web app experience.

### Core Concept
- **Dashboard Navigation**: Instead of scrolling through sections, visitors navigate modules (Projects, Blog, Contact, Playground) as if they were separate applications
- **Interactive Experience**: Showcase ability to design usable interfaces, data-driven layouts, and modular systems
- **Professional Demonstration**: Prove competency in modern web development practices and user experience design



## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Framework**: React (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for page transitions and micro-interactions
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js or Recharts for analytics dashboard
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout


### Performance Requirements
- **Lighthouse Score**: 90+ across all metrics
- **Core Web Vitals**: All metrics in "Good" range
- **Loading Time**: < 2 seconds initial load
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB initial JavaScript bundle

## üß© Application Structure & Features

### 1. Dashboard Layout
**Top Navigation with App-Style Modules:**
- üóÇ **Projects** - Portfolio showcase with detailed case studies
- üìä **Analytics** - Skills visualization with interactive charts
- üìù **Blog/Case Studies** - Technical writing and project deep-dives
- üé® **Playground** - Interactive demos and experiments
- üì¨ **Contact** - Professional contact form with real-time features

### 2. Projects as Mini-Applications
Each project functions as a standalone app with:
- **Live Preview**: Embedded iframe with theme toggling (light/dark)
- **Details Tab**: Problem statement, role, tech stack, results, metrics
- **Code Tab**: GitHub integration with syntax-highlighted code snippets
- **Demo Tab**: Full-screen modal or inline project execution
- **Case Study Tab**: Detailed walkthrough of development process

### 3. Interactive Widgets & Components
- **Skill Meter**: Fitness tracker-style progress bars for technical skills
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time GitHub activity and blog post updates
- **Notification Bell**: Easter egg feature showing new updates and achievements
- **Theme Customizer**: Live preview of color palette and typography changes
- **Settings Panel**: Comprehensive customization options

### 4. Personalization & Play Features
- **Theme System**: Multiple color palettes (Default Blue, Purple, Green, Orange)
- **Typography Controls**: Font size options (Compact, Default, Comfortable)
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion toggle and high contrast mode
- **Easter Eggs**: Konami code unlocks hidden "secret project"
- **Interactive Demos**: Live coding examples and component playgrounds

## üé® Design System & UI Requirements

### Theme System Implementation
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Smooth transitions with system preference detection
- **Color Palette Customization**: 4 preset themes with live preview
- **Typography Scale**: Responsive font sizing with accessibility considerations
- **Component Library**: Consistent shadcn/ui components with custom theming
- **State Persistence**: User preferences stored in localStorage via Zustand

### Animation Strategy
- **Page Transitions**: Slide animations between modules using Framer Motion
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover states, button clicks, loading states
- **Data Visualization**: Chart entrance animations and interactive elements
- **Easter Egg Animations**: Surprise interactions and hidden features
- **Performance Optimization**: Transform-based animations with will-change properties
