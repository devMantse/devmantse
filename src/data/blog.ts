    content: `# Building a Modern Portfolio Dashboard

Creating a portfolio that stands out in today's competitive market requires more than just a simple website. In this article, I'll walk you through building a modern, interactive portfolio dashboard using React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

## The Vision

Instead of a traditional scrolling portfolio, I wanted to create something that feels like a professional SaaS application. The goal was to demonstrate not just my work, but my ability to design and build complex, interactive interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Dashboard Navigation**: Module-based navigation similar to popular SaaS applications
- **Interactive Components**: Real-time theme switching, animated transitions, and responsive design
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, code splitting, and optimized bundle sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance and keyboard navigation support

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, type-safe state management
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

## Implementation Highlights

### Theme System
One of the most interesting features is the dynamic theme system. Users can switch between light/dark modes and customize color palettes in real-time.

\`\`\`typescript
const useThemeStore = create<ThemeState>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      theme: 'system',
      colorPalette: 'blue',
      setTheme: (theme) => set({ theme }),
      setColorPalette: (colorPalette) => set({ colorPalette }),
    }),
    { name: 'portfolio-theme' }
  )
)
\`\`\`

### Component Architecture
The modular architecture allows for easy maintenance and scalability. Each module (Projects, Analytics, Blog, etc.) is self-contained with its own components and data.

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting at the module level
- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Optimized images and assets
- Efficient state management with Zustand

## Results

The final portfolio achieved:
- 95+ Lighthouse performance score
- Sub-2-second initial load time
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Full accessibility compliance

## Lessons Learned

Building this portfolio taught me valuable lessons about:
- The importance of performance in user experience
- How to balance complexity with usability
- The power of modern React patterns and hooks
- The value of comprehensive TypeScript usage

## Next Steps

Future enhancements will include:
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Integration with external APIs
- Progressive Web App capabilities

This project demonstrates not just technical skills, but the ability to think about user experience and create something that truly stands out in the developer community.`,

    content: `# Optimizing React Performance: A Deep Dive into Memoization

Performance optimization in React is crucial for creating smooth, responsive user experiences. In this comprehensive guide, I'll explore the various memoization techniques available in React and when to use them.

## Understanding React's Rendering Process

Before diving into optimization techniques, it's important to understand how React renders components and when re-renders occur.

## Memoization Techniques

### React.memo
React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes the result of a component's render.

\`\`\`typescript
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data, onUpdate }) => {
  // Component logic
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Custom comparison function
  return prevProps.data.id === nextProps.data.id;
});
\`\`\`

### useMemo Hook
useMemo memoizes the result of a computation and only recalculates when dependencies change.

\`\`\`typescript
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
  return computeExpensiveValue(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
\`\`\`

### useCallback Hook
useCallback memoizes a function and only recreates it when dependencies change.

\`\`\`typescript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
\`\`\`
